# WildfireSimulation
This program simulates fire spreading through an area with different kinds of terrain. The user can change the terrain type and start fires. The user interface is built using PyQt5.

# Features
There are two clicking modes that can be chosen from the menu to the right. By default, clicking a tile will light a fire at the location unless the tile cannot be lit on fire. When painting tiles, clicking the tile will convert the terrain at the location to whichever kind of tile is currently selected in the menu. The map size can be changed from a drop-down menu, which will generate a new empty area with only grass tiles. The user can also save and load their current terrain map, though any burn states will be ignored when reloading.
